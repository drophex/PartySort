# PartySort
Just a small exercise inspired by a job interview. The goal is:

Cindy wants to know whether her friends will attend to her birthday party. Her nerd friend Herbert has implemented a voting application.
The friends of Cindy can vote if they want to participate or not. One day before Herbert left for his vacation he sent Cindy the voting results. Cindy is shocked.
She doesn't know how to find out how many friends actually will participate in her party.

You want to help Cindy by writing code that returns the list of names of friends who plan to participate in her party.

Follow these rules:
It should not matter if friends used uppercase or lowercase letters for their name. It is still the same person.
The chronologiacal order of the votes matters. Only the last vote for a person matters
